## 🔐 API Endpoints

| Endpoint         | Method | Description              |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| `/api/register/` | POST   | Register a new user      |
| `/api/login/`    | POST   | Obtain JWT token (login) |
| `/api/refresh/`  | POST   | Refresh access token     |

### 🔑 JWT Auth Flow

- Login to obtain:

  ```json
  {
    "access": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJh...",
    "refresh": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJh..."
  }
  ```

- Use the `access` token in headers:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
  ```

- Refresh token using `/api/refresh/`.
